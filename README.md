# RBAC-System_Angular
=======
#Overview

This Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system allows you to manage user access levels based on their roles within the application. Users can be assigned different roles (e.g., Manager, Employee) which determine the level of access they have to various resources and functionalities within the application.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.8.

##Features

Role Management: Create, update, and delete user roles.
User Authentication: Users are authenticated based on their username and password.
Role Assignment: Users are assigned specific roles (e.g.,Manager, Employee) to control access.
Access Control: Resources and routes are protected based on user roles, ensuring that only authorized users can access them.
Login Redirection: After login, users are redirected to different dashboards based on their role.
Session Management: Usersâ€™ session data is stored in local storage for persistent authentication.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
